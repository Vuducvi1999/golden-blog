## Error solving
1. **_Sign up_ for new account**

	If you get this error when you try to create account, that is because gmail prevent any access from new location (our app). Now we need to grant required access by going to http://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha and click continue. After this step, gmail will let 10 minutes for registering new app.

2. **Haven’t got any email, try to search on spam email.**

3. **Contact us page is not working.**

	This should be a feature but I haven’t done yet.
